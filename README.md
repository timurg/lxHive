## <a name="introduction" />Introduction

**lxHive** is a fast and lightweight open source xAPI conformant Learning Record Store (LRS).
**lxHive** logs and returns activity statements as defined in the [Experience API specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec) (formerly TinCan API) currently at xAPI Version 1.0.2.

The Experience API (also referred to as 'xAPI') is a learning software specification that allows online learning content and systems to [interact](https://tincanapi.com/overview/) allowing recording and tracking of all types of learning experiences. It is designed to replace the legacy SCORM Standard and is steered by the US Dept. of Defense [ADL](http://www.adlnet.gov/) (Advanced Distributed Learning). It allows for the efficient aggregation and analysis of learning data as well as allowing learning designers a flexible and intelligent way to design better learning experiences. The Experience API is able to accept learning experiences from any device and/or medium (mobile, tablet, desktop), both in an offline as well as online mode.

The results of learning experiences are stored in a Learning Record Store (LRS). The LRS is defined as part of the Experience API Specification and controls at its core the following functions:

1. authentication of authorised users
2. validation of compliance to the xAPI Standard
3. the storage of learning related data
4. retrieval of learning related data

The application uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) and [PHP](http://php.net/) and should be easy to install on any web server. It supports Basic Authentication, OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant) and supports pluggable file storage mechanisms.

## <a name="installation" />Installation

### Requirements

* PHP >= 5.4, with [mongo extension](http://php.net/manual/en/mongo.installation.php) installed
* (optional) PHPUnit to run tests.
* .htaccess enabled (or similar HTTP rewrite function)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed
* [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.org/) installed (supports Mongo 3.x)
* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)

#### Notes:

* Make sure you have set the `date.timezone` setting in your php.ini

### Setup

* see also our Wiki for a comprehensive [step-bystep guide](https://github.com/Brightcookie/lxHive/wiki/Step-by-step:-Install-lxHive-and-setup-authentication-for-your-app)

#### 1. Application install and set-up

1. Install dependencies via `composer install`.
2. Point your server's `DocumentRoot` directive to the `public` folder
3. Set up your database & client account:

```bash

# Browse to application root
$ cd /<path_to_application_root>
# View available commands
$ ./X
# Set up database
$ ./X setup:db
# Set up OAuth scopes
$ ./X setup:oauth
# Create a new user
$ ./X user:create

```

#### Notes:

* As an administrator you should first create a new user and authentication token for yourself and assign the *super* role to it.

#### 2. Create autentication records for your app

```
./X auth:basic:create     # Create a new basic auth token
./X oauth:client:create   # Or create a new OAuth client (human login)
```

#### 3. Set-up file Storage and extended config

1. Optionally: Further customise your configuration in `src/xAPI/Config/Config.yml`

    * TODO: explain options

2. Set up you local file system:

    * Create your storage directory as defined in `Config.yml > filesystem.local`.
    * Create the required `files` and `log` sub directories.
    * Assign the appropiate `r\w` permissions for your system.

Default file storage structure:

```
[lxHivE]
    |_ [storage]
    |   |_ [files]
    |   |_ [logs]
    |
    ...
```
